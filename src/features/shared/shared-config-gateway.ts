/**
 * Single gateway for the shared config files that several rulesync features
 * read-modify-write (`.claude/settings.json`, `.hermes/config.yaml`,
 * `.takt/config.yaml`, `opencode.json`, ...). It unifies the three concerns
 * that used to be scattered across per-file helper modules
 * (claudecode-settings-gateway / hermes-config / takt-config / opencode-config):
 *
 * 1. **Format codecs** — parsing and serializing YAML/JSON/JSONC with one
 *    empty-file rule and one prototype-pollution hardening pass.
 * 2. **Conflict policies** — the named merge semantics a feature can declare
 *    (`replace-owned-keys`, `deep-merge`), implemented once instead of being
 *    re-spelled per tool (the takt `provider_options` sibling-clobber and the
 *    hermes-class merge bugs were re-implementations going subtly wrong).
 * 3. **Ownership declarations** — {@link SHARED_CONFIG_OWNERSHIP} states, per
 *    file and per feature, which keys the feature owns and which policy
 *    resolves conflicts. {@link applySharedConfigPatch} executes the declared
 *    policy, and rejects writes outside the declared ownership.
 *
 * The cross-feature *order* in which these writers run is derived from the
 * registry in `src/lib/shared-file-derive.ts` (`SHARED_WRITE_FEATURE_ORDER`),
 * and the no-data-loss contract is enforced end-to-end by
 * `src/lib/shared-file-contract.test.ts`.

 * far more often than they are generated — and re-serializing would delete
 * every one of them, along with the author's blank lines and key order. So a
 * JSONC document is written back as a set of edits against the existing text:
 * regions the merge did not change stay byte-identical, and a regeneration
 * that changes nothing leaves the file untouched.
 *
 * The whole-document writer is still used when there is nothing to preserve or
 * nothing to edit against:
 *
 * - an empty (or whitespace-only) file, which has no comments to keep;
 * - a file that does not parse, or whose root is not an object — editing it
 *   would mean guessing at the author's intent, and the callers that reach
 *   here have already decided (via `invalidRootPolicy`) that such a file is
 *   replaced;
 * - a file stating the same key twice, or using `__proto__`, `constructor` or
 *   `prototype` as a key (see {@link uneditableKeyOf});
 * - a file so large, with so much of it changing, that editing it key by key
 *   would take longer than a user would wait (see
 *   {@link JSONC_EDIT_BUDGET_BYTES}), or changed keys that write more new text
 *   between them than re-indenting can afford (see
 *   {@link JSONC_EDIT_WRITTEN_BYTES});
 * - a file the editor itself refuses, which it answers with an exception
 *   rather than a result.
 *
 * Every one of those fallbacks except the empty file is reported once per run
 * through `logger` (or the fallback logger when none is given): the author's
 * comments are what the edit path exists to keep, and a `generate` that drops
 * them should say so rather than let the loss show up in the next diff.
 * `filePath` names the file in that warning; callers that know it should pass
 * it, since the once-per-run token is the message itself and two nameless
 * files would share one.
 *
 * `leadingKeys` names the root keys that go in front of every other property
 * when the edit path inserts them (the whole-document writer keeps the order
 * `document` states, so the caller places them there itself). A key the file
 * already has stays where the file put it.
